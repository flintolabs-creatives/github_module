# About Me - Example

## 👋 Hi, I'm Alex Chen!

### 🎓 Grade/School
10th Grade at Mountain View High School

### 💡 Why I'm Learning AI
I want to build AI tools that help students study more effectively. I also think it would be cool to create an AI that can identify plants and animals on hiking trails!

### 🎮 Hobbies & Interests
- Playing guitar and writing songs
- Photography (especially nature photos)
- Reading sci-fi novels
- Playing basketball

### 🚀 Dream AI Project
An AI music tutor that listens to you play and gives you personalized feedback on your technique, kind of like having a guitar teacher available 24/7!

### 🌟 Fun Fact
I once hiked to the top of a mountain at sunrise to take the perfect photo, and it was totally worth it! 🏔️
