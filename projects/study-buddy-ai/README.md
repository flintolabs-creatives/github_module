# Study Buddy AI

**Created by:** Alex Chen
**Date:** January 2026

## 🎯 What It Does
Study Buddy AI is a chatbot that helps students prepare for tests by quizzing them on their notes. You upload your study materials, and it generates practice questions!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenAI API (GPT-4)
- Streamlit (for the web interface)
- LangChain (for document processing)

## 💡 How It Works
1. Students upload their study notes (PDF or text)
2. The AI reads and understands the content
3. It generates multiple-choice and short-answer questions
4. Students can practice and get instant feedback
5. The AI explains wrong answers to help learning

## 🚀 What I Learned
- How to process PDF documents with Python
- How to craft effective prompts for educational content
- Building user-friendly interfaces with Streamlit
- The importance of testing with real study materials

## 📸 Demo

**Key Features:**
- ✅ Uploads PDFs up to 10 pages
- ✅ Generates 5-10 questions per session
- ✅ Provides detailed explanations
- ✅ Tracks your score

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add flashcard mode
- Include voice input for questions
- Create a mobile app version
- Add spaced repetition algorithm
- Support more file formats (Word docs, PowerPoints)

## 💭 Reflection
This was my first real AI project! The hardest part was getting the AI to generate questions at the right difficulty level. I learned that prompt engineering is super important - small changes in how you ask the AI makes a huge difference in the quality of questions.
