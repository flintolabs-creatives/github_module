# GitHub Glossary 📖

Common terms you'll hear when working with Git and GitHub.

## 🔤 The Basics

### Repository (Repo)
A project folder that Git tracks. Contains all your code, files, and the history of changes.
**Think of it as:** A project folder with superpowers - it remembers every change ever made!

### Clone
Making a copy of a repository from GitHub to your computer.
**Think of it as:** Downloading a project to work on locally.

### Commit
Saving a snapshot of your changes with a message describing what you did.
**Think of it as:** A save point in a video game - you can always go back to it!

### Push
Uploading your commits from your computer to GitHub.
**Think of it as:** Backing up your work to the cloud.

### Pull
Downloading the latest changes from GitHub to your computer.
**Think of it as:** Getting updates that others made.

### Branch
A separate version of your code where you can make changes without affecting the main version.
**Think of it as:** A parallel universe where you can experiment safely.

### Merge
Combining changes from one branch into another.
**Think of it as:** Bringing your experimental work back into the main project.

## 🌿 Working with Branches

### Main Branch (or Master)
The primary branch of your repository. Usually contains the "official" working version.
**Think of it as:** The main storyline in a game.

## 💾 Saving Your Work

### Staging (or Index)
Preparing files to be committed. You choose which changes to include.
**Think of it as:** Deciding which items to put in your shopping cart before checkout.

### Working Directory
The folder on your computer where you edit files.

## 🔀 Collaboration

### Fork

**Think of it as:** Photocopying a recipe to modify for yourself.

### Pull Request (PR)

**Think of it as:** Submitting your homework for review.

### Review
When someone looks at your code and gives feedback.
**Think of it as:** Peer editing for code.

### Conflict
When two people change the same part of a file differently.

## 📊 Tracking Changes

### Diff
The difference between two versions of a file.
**Think of it as:** Track changes in Microsoft Word, but for code.

### History
A log of all commits made to a repository.
**Think of it as:** A complete timeline of everything that happened to the project.

### Blame
Seeing who made each change to a file (not as mean as it sounds!).
**Think of it as:** Finding out who wrote which part of the code.

---

## 🛠️ Special Files

### .gitignore
A file that tells Git which files to ignore (not track).
**Think of it as:** A "do not disturb" list for certain files.

### README.md
A file that explains what your project is about.
**Think of it as:** The cover page of your project.

### .md (Markdown)
A simple way to format text files (like this glossary!).
**Think of it as:** A simpler version of Word formatting.

---

## ⚙️ Advanced Concepts

### SHA / Hash
A unique ID for each commit (looks like: `a3f5b2c`).
**Think of it as:** A barcode for each save point.

### Stash
Temporarily saving changes without committing them.
**Think of it as:** Putting your work in a drawer to clean up your desk.

### Rebase
A way to reorganize commits (advanced - ask instructor first!).
**Think of it as:** Reorganizing your timeline (use with caution!).

### Tag
A label for a specific commit (often used for versions like v1.0).
**Think of it as:** A bookmark for an important moment.

---

## 🚫 What NOT to Do

### Force Push
Forcing your changes to overwrite others (dangerous!).
**What it is:** The nuclear option - use ONLY if instructor says to.

### Rewrite History
Changing past commits (very advanced and risky).
**What it is:** Time travel - usually a bad idea when working with others.
